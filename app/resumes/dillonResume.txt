This allowed the client to find out if their customers were satisfied with their product within days rather than months. 
Worked on side projects such as game development or paint utilizing languages and libraries such as: Java, C++, SDL, ALLEGRO, and MFC. Some of which can be found at; https://sites.google.com/site/onmysparetimedesigns/

~Projects
My projects are made using different API’s and are done without the aid of a pre-made game engine.
Decided to take the longer approach of learning the individual aspects of the game mechanics by handling them personally myself.
Among these game mechanics is inertia, accelerating, gravity, simplistic AI, animation, tile based maps, frame regulation, collision, and an even greater understanding of memory optimization.
These can be viewed within my website below.
