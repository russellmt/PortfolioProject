~Summary:
Software engineer that sees programming as the greatest potential of raw creation itself.
Most recent software worked on was a program developed at J.D. Power that analyzed and filtered mass databases while converting said data into a visually appealing and client friendly application.
This allowed the client to find out if their customers were satisfied with their product within days rather than months. 
Worked on side projects such as game development or paint utilizing languages and libraries such as: Java, C++, SDL, ALLEGRO, and MFC. Some of which can be found at; https://sites.google.com/site/onmysparetimedesigns/

~Certifications:
C / C++ Certification
Computer Science Certification
Microsoft Office Certification

~Technical Summary:
Languages:
Java, JavaScript, C++, VBScript
Additional Skills: 
ExtJS, BackBone JS, JellyScript, Mockito, OOP, Design Patterns
Game Development, OpenGl, SDL, MFC, ALLEGRO, JSON
Software:
GIT, Alfresco, Microsoft Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDE, Eclipse IDE

~Education:
Los Angeles Valley College
Associates Degree, Computer Science, pending

~Projects:
My projects are made using different API’s and are done without the aid of a pre-made game engine.
Decided to take the longer approach of learning the individual aspects of the game mechanics by handling them personally myself.
Among these game mechanics is inertia, accelerating, gravity, simplistic AI, animation, tile based maps, frame regulation, collision, and an even greater understanding of memory optimization.
These can be viewed within my website below.
